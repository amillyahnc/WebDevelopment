    <!-- Challenge 1: Create a div container with id of banner.  Add a heading 1 with the text "Gallery" to the container.-->
<div id="banner">
<h1>Gallery</h1>
</div>

    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a div container with class of subbanner. Add a heading 3 with appropriate text that
                      represents the theme of the first photo gallery -->
<div class = "subannner">
<h3>"Theater"</h3>
</div>
    <!-- Challenge 3: Add a brief paragraph describing the theme of the first photo gallery -->
<p>My photo gallery will be based off of the thrill of theater. Many people say that theater is an awkward investment for a child to invite themselves into. Although I believe it to be a work of fine art. The emotion and passion you see on a child's face,it compares nothing to another.  </p>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a div container with a class of gallery and an id of firstGallery.  Add at least three images based 
                      on the theme of the first photo gallery-->
<div class="gallery">
  <div id="firstGallery">
<img src=""
  </div>
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a div container with class of subbanner. Add a heading 3 with appropriate text that

<div class="subanner">
  <h3>Stand Up Comedy</h3>
</div>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Add a brief paragraph describing the theme of the second photo gallery -->
<p>Stand up comedy sometimes connects to theater as well. Many may believe some comedians can come off as a bit impulsive, but they're generally a nice franchise. I personally believe if there were more child like comedians, the world would heal in a sense. </p>
